This project focuses on the collection, processing, and visualization of traffic accident data in Greece, aiming to uncover key patterns and risk factors that can inform public safety initiatives and urban planning.

Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas): For API integration, data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
Tableau: For interactive and insightful dashboards and geographic visualizations.

Data Acquisition
Traffic accident data was retrieved via a public API,
offering real-time or regularly updated datasets from Greek sources. 
Python scripts were developed to automate the fetching and structuring of this data into usable formats (CSV).

Data Analysis
Temporal trends: Accidents per year/month/day & time of day.
Geographic breakdown: High-risk areas identified via heatmaps.

Project Goals
Identify critical accident patterns and contributing factors.
Support data-driven decision-making for road safety policies.
Raise public awareness through clear and accessible visuals.
